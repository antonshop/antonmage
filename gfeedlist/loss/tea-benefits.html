					<p>Recent findings show that drinking 3 or more cups of tea a day may help to reduce the risk of stroke and death from stroke by 21%.</p>
					<p>Arab, L., Liu, W. and Elashoff, D. (2009). Green and black tea consumption and risk of stroke. A meta-analysis. Stroke, DOI:10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.538470.</p>

					<h3>Long term tea drinking is associated with a reduced prevalence of diabetes in an elderly population</h3>
					<p>Analysis revealed that drinking 1 - 2 cups of tea per day was associated with the greatest benefit on blood glucose levels; drinking more provided no further benefit. An increase of one cup per day was associated with a 70% lower likelihood of having diabetes (95% CI 41%-86%), after adjusting for confounding variables.</p>

            	<h3>Green tea and cholesterol</h3>
				<p>In a Taiwanese randomised controlled trial, 78 obese women who took 400mg of green tea extract three times a day for 12 weeks experienced significant reduction in LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and a simultaneous increase in levels of HDL-cholesterol, and the hormones adiponectin (promotes insulin sensitivity) and ghrelin (modulates hunger).</p>
                <p>(Effect of green tea extract on obese women: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Clin Nutr. 2008 Jun;27(3):363-70).</p>
                <h3>Green tea expands blood vessels</h3>
                <p>Researchers from Greece tested subjects after they consumed green tea, 125mg of caffeine and 450ml of hot water on three separate occasions. They measured the diameter of the brachial artery in each participant 30, 90 and 120 minutes after they consumed each beverage.</p>
                <p>Arterial dilation increased significantly with tea by 3.69%, peaking at 30 min, whereas it did not change significantly with caffeine or water.</p>
                <p>(The acute effect of green tea consumption on endothelial function in healthy individuals. Eur J Cardiovasc Prev Rehabil. 2008 Jun;15(3):300-5).</p>
                <h3>Tea is good for the brain</h3>
                <p>A cohort study of 2501 people from Singapore has found that regular tea consumption is associated with lower risks of cognitive impairment and decline.</p>
                <p>The effects were most evident for black (fermented) and oolong (semi-fermented) teas. In contrast, no association between coffee intake and cognitive status was found.</p>
                <p>(Tea consumption and cognitive impairment and decline in older Chinese adults. Am J Clin Nutr. 2008 Jul;88(1):224-31).</p>
                <h3>Green tea prevents fatty liver</h3>
                <p>A US team fed groups of genetically obese and lean mice a diet containing zero, 1%, or 2% green tea extract for six weeks.</p>
                <p>At the end of the study, the obese mice fed green tea extract weighed 23-25% less than obese mice fed the non-supplemented diet and the lean mice fed green tea extract weighed 11-20% less those on the non-supplemented diet.</p>
                <h3>Drinking green tea before exercise could help burn fat.</h3>
                <p>In an study, 12 healthy young men took either green tea extract, equivalent to 3.5 cups of tea, or placebo, before taking part in cycling trials. Average fat oxidation rates were 17% higher in the green tea group and the contribution of fat oxidation to total energy expenditure was also significantly higher.</p>
                <p>In a second experiment, 11 healthy men took an oral-glucose-tolerance test before and after supplementation with capsules containing either green tea extract or placebo.</p>
                <p>Ingestion of green tea extract was found to increase insulin sensitivity by 13%, meaning that it could potentially reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.</p>
                <p>(Green tea extract ingestion, fat oxidation, and glucose tolerance in healthy humans. Am J Clin Nutr. 2008 Mar;87(3):778-84).</p>
                <h3>Tea reduces stress</h3>
                <p>A recent human study has found that people who drank tea four times a day, for six weeks, had lower blood cortisol levels and were able to recover more quickly after a stressful event compared with those who drank a placebo beverage.</p>
                <p>(The effects of tea on psychophysiological stress responsivity and post-stress recovery: a randomised double-blind trial. Psychopharmacology (Berl). 2007 Jan;190(1):81-9).<br />
In another study volunteers were given theanine (an amino acid found in high proportion in tea leaves), a placebo or nothing, either at the start of a stressful mental arithmetic task, or midway through it.</p>
                <p>The results showed that theanine intake resulted in a significant reduction in the stress response (measured via heart rate (HR) and salivary immunoglobulin A (s-IgA)). Analyses of heart rate variability indicated that the reductions in HR and s-IgA were likely to be due to attenuation of sympathetic nervous activation. The authors concluded that oral theanine could mediate anti-stress effects via inhibition of cortical neuronal excitation in the brain.</p>
                <p>(L-Theanine reduces psychological and physiological stress responses. Biol Psychol. 2007 Jan;74(1):39-45).</p>
                <h3>Green tea and cognitive decline</h3>
                <p>According to a study of more than 1000 Japanese adults in their 70s, drinking green tea regularly seems to be connected to a reduced risk of cognitive decline.</p>
                <p>People drinking two or more cups of green tea a day, were half as likely to show signs of cognitive impairment as those who drank three cups or less a week.</p>
                <p>Even though the study wasn't able to show a clear connection between drinking green tea and maintaining mental acuity, it may help explain why there is less dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease, in Japan compared to Europe and North America.</p>

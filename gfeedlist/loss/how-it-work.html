        Green tea has been drunk in China for its health benefits for thousands of years. There are many different varieties and the <span class="hwork_title">3 used in Tava Tea have been chosen for their weight loss boosting and general health benefits.</span><br>
Tava Tea wellness blend works by burning extra calories, in fact it burns 2.5 times more calories than green tea. A study by Japan's University of Tokushima School of Medicine discovered that regular Oolong tea drinkers experienced over twice the calorie burning of drinking the same amount of Japanese green tea.<br />
You'll read a lot on Slimming+ regarding carbs causing insulin spikes and how too much insulin will stop your body burning stored fat and encourage fat storage, which you obviously need to avoid. Scientists at the Suntory Research Center in Osaka, Japan, found that <span class="hwork_title">drinking Oolong tea 15 minutes before eating carbs, lessens the insulin spike normally associated with eating carbs.</span><br />
In a Taiwanese randomised controlled trial, 78 obese women who took 400mg of green tea extract three times a day for 12 weeks experienced significant <span class="hwork_title">reduction in LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels</span>, and a simultaneous increase in levels of HDL-cholesterol, and the hormones adiponectin (promotes insulin sensitivity) and ghrelin (modulates hunger).<br />
(Effect of green tea extract on obese women: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Clin Nutr. 2008 Jun;27(3):363-70).<br />
A blind study was conducted in France several years ago with 500 hyperlipidemia patients (An advanced cholesterol condition, usually controlled with medication). Half of the controlled group consumed 3-4 cups of Pu'erh daily, the rest of the patients were given something else.<br />
After 30-days the results showed <span class="hwork_title">drinking Pu'erh on a regular basis could significantly lower cholesterol.</span><br />
A US team fed groups of genetically obese and lean mice a diet containing zero, 1%, or 2% green tea extract for six weeks. At the end of the study, the obese mice fed green tea extract weighed 23-25% less than obese mice fed the non-supplemented diet and the lean mice fed green tea extract weighed 11-20% less those on the non-supplemented diet.<br />
Analysis revealed that drinking 1 - 2 cups of tea per day was associated with the greatest benefit on blood glucose levels; drinking more provided no further benefit. An increase of one cup per day was associated with a 70% lower likelihood of having diabetes (95% CI 41%-86%), after adjusting for confounding variables.<br />

"Long-term tea intake is associated with reduced prevalence of (type 2) diabetes mellitus among elderly people from Mediterranean islands: MEDIS epidemiological study." Yonsei Med J. 2009 28;50(1):31-8.<br />
Then of course there are the general health benefits of these special teas.<br />
A study published in Antioxidants & Redox Signalling, found that <span class="hwork_title">test subjects consuming wu long had stronger immune systems and a reduced risk for infections</span> and researchers from Japan's Shiga University of Medical Science found that drinking wu long each day helped to clear up skin problems within one month.<br />
Pu-erh tea is often consumed by Chinese after a greasy or fatty meal. The fat digests faster and you experience far less bloating normally associated with a heavy meal.<br />
Another great benefit of this tea is that it can calm your mind and body thanks to the fact it contains the amino acid L-theanine. This amino is responsible for boosting alpha brain wave activity and increasing the production of the calming neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin.<br />
This is useful as being on a diet can be stressful and anything that can ease that has got to be a good thing.
